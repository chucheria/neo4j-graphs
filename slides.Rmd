1. About Graphs
2. About Neo4j data in R
3. About analyzing and visualizing Neo4j data in R

# Graphs + Neo4j

## Graphs + Neo4j {.title-h2}

**A graph G is a collection of entities (nodes) and the relationships (edges) that connect those entities**

**_G = {N, E}_**

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Connector
library(RNeo4j)
# Manipulate data
library(dplyr)
# Work with graphs
library(igraph)
# Visualize
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(visNetwork)

graph <- startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/", username="neo4j", password="root")
```

```{r kevin, echo=FALSE}
q <- "MATCH (a:Actor { name: 'Kevin Bacon' })--(m:Movie) RETURN a.name AS from, m.title AS to, m.releaseDate AS epoch"
bacon <- cypher(graph, q) %>%
  mutate(epoch = as.numeric(epoch),
         year = format(as.POSIXct(epoch/1000, origin="1970-01-01"), format="%Y"),
         recent = ifelse(year >= 2000, TRUE, FALSE)) 

ig <- graph_from_data_frame(bacon)
data <- toVisNetworkData(ig)
visNetwork(nodes = data$nodes, edges = data$edges, height = "500px")
```

## Graphs + Neo4j {.title-h2}

- _What does math say?_

Graphs can be undirected 

- _What does Neo4j say?_

You have to make directed relationships.
Forget about them when you make your queries.

## Graphs + Neo4j {.title-h2}

Nodes can have properties.

Relationships can have properties.

Node labels are the best. Gives us set advantages.

```{r properties}
q <- ("MATCH (n:Movie { title: 'Footloose' }) 
      RETURN properties(n) AS properties")
properties <- cypherToList(graph, q)

purrr::map(properties, ~names(.x$properties))
```
